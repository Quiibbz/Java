This is a repository of my Java programming assignments I had to do throughout my time at Sacramento State University.

They are the versions I submitted for a grade, untouched (excluding a few comments to explain what each program is meant to do) so you have an idea of how I design my code,
as well as my thought process for solving the problems presented to me.
